1. values added:  20
2. final result:  20
3. values added:  20
4. returns an error because variable `result` scope is within the if statement, not outside of it; hence, `result` is undefined on line 13.
5. code returns an error at line 7 because the code tries to change the value stored in variable `result`, which is not possible because it is `const` meaning that it cannot be changed.
6. same reasoning as to what occured for `question 5`.
